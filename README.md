### Work In Progress

This implementation of [`Artillery`](https://github.com/abstractive/artillery) is the reference implementation for the other languages at present, until another language or language platform can out-perform `Crystal` in the wild. `Crystal` feels perfect as the language to start from because it's almost _designed_ for writing microservices.


## Ignore Documentation

All information about this exists in the [Issues](https://github.com/abstractive/artillery.cr/issues) primarily, by way of implication; as well as in discussion threads at [delimiter chambers](https://github.com/delimiterchambers).

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "artillery"
```
